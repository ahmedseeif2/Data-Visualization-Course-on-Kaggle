# Data-Visualization-Course-on-Kaggle
In this hands-on micro-course on Kaggle, I learned how to take my data visualizations to the next level with seaborn, a powerful but easy-to-use data visualization tool. To use seaborn, I also learned how to write code in Python.
The micro-course is aimed at those with no prior programming experience, and each chart uses short and simple code, making seaborn much faster and easier to use than many other data visualization tools (such as Excel, for instance).
